<h2>Where did Burgers come from?</h2>
<body>
    Burgers originated in a place called Hamburg, Germany. German immigrants arrived in New York and Chicago and began opening a restaurants.
     They sold what they call "hamburg" steaks which was an Americanized version of the German origin. During the industrial revolution, factory workers needed something quick and fast to eat.
     Thus the idea of food carts serving hamburgers was born. The ingenious idea of putting a hamburger steak between bread allowed factory workers to eat while on the go.
